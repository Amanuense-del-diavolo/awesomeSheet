      <div contentEditable="true" class="textarea textarea-special-abilities">
        <p><strong>Arcane Bond (Su)</strong> You have selected to establish a powerful arcane bond with a creature.</p>
        <p><strong>Bonus Feats</strong> At 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th level, a wizard gains a bonus feat. At each such opportunity, he can choose a metamagic feat, an item creation feat, or Spell Mastery. The wizard must still meet all prerequisites for a bonus feat, including caster level minimums. These bonus feats are in addition to the feats that a character of any class gets from advancing levels. The wizard is not limited to the categories of item creation feats, metamagic feats, or Spell Mastery when choosing those feats.</p>
        <p><strong>Cantrips</strong> You can prepare a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, each day. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again. You can prepare a cantrip from a prohibited school, but it uses up two of your available slots.</p>
        <p><strong>Conjuration School</strong> You have chosen to specialize in conjuration spells.</p>
        <p><strong>Elven Immunities (Ex)</strong> Elves are immune to magic sleep effects and get a +2 racial saving throw bonus against enchantment spells and effects.</p>
        <p><strong>Elven Magic (Ex)</strong> Elves receive a +2 racial bonus on caster level checks made to overcome spell resistance. In addition, elves receive a +2 racial bonus on Spellcraft skill checks made to identify the properties of magic items.</p>
        <p><strong>Enchantment Opposition School</strong> You have chosen enchantment spells as an opposition school. Preparing an enchantment spell takes up two spell slots of the same level. You take a -4 penalty on any skill checks made when crafting a magic item that has an enchantment spell as a prerequisite.</p>
        <p><strong>Familiar</strong> A familiar grants special abilities to its master. These special abilities apply only when the master and familiar are within 1 mile of each other.</p>
        <p><strong>Bower</strong> (Rat) Master gains a +2 bonus on Fortitude saves</p>
        <p><strong>Headband of Intellect Skill Selection (Use Magic Device)</strong> </p>
        <p><strong>Keen Senses (Ex)</strong> Elves receive a +2 bonus on Perception skill checks.</p>
        <p><strong>Low-Light Vision (Ex)</strong> You can see x2 as far as humans in low illumination. Characters with low-light vision have eyes that are so sensitive to light that they can see twice as far as normal in dim light. Low-Light Vision is color vision. A spellcaster with low-light vision can read a scroll as long as even the tiniest candle flame is next to her as a source of light. Characters with low-light vision can see outdoors on a moonlit night as well as they can during the day.</p>
        <p><strong>Necromancy Opposition School</strong> You have chosen necromancy spells as an opposition school. Preparing an necromancy spell takes up two spell slots of the same level. You take a -4 penalty on any skill checks made when crafting a magic item that has an necromancy spell as a prerequisite.</p>
        <p><strong>Resilient</strong> Growing up in a violent neighborhood or in the unforgiving wilds often forced you to subsist on food and water from doubtful sources. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Fortitude saves.</p>
        <p><strong>Shift (Su)</strong> At 1st level, you can teleport to a nearby space as a swift action as if using dimension door. This movement does not provoke an attack of opportunity. You must be able to see the space that you are moving into. You cannot take other creatures with you when you use this ability (except for familiars). You can move 10 feet. You can use this ability 9 times per day.</p>
        <p><strong>Summoner's Charm (Su)</strong> When casting Conjuration (summoning) spells the duration is increased by 2 rounds.</p>
        <p><strong>Teleportation School</strong> </p>
        <p><strong>Weapon Familiarity (Ex)</strong> Elves are proficient with longbows (including composite longbows), longswords, rapiers, and shortbows (including composite shortbows), and treat any weapon with the word "elven" in its name as a martial weapon.</p>
